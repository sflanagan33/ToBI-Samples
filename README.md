# Trouble on Beryl Isle - Samples
Hey! This repository contains some sample code and assets taken from my third VGDev game, [Trouble on Beryl Isle](http://sflanagan33.github.io/#trouble-on-beryl-isle). It's mostly intended as a companion to [this breakdown article](http://sflanagan33.github.io/tobi) on the tools, systems, characters, and effects I did for the game. These selections are here in case you want to take an even closer look at how I put things together.

With very few exceptions, everything in this repository is my work (I've made disclaimers in the article where needed.)
***
These assets are only uploaded as a demonstration of the kind of work I do, and are not intended for reuse in other projects, games or otherwise. I can't make any guarantee of their completeness or functionality.
